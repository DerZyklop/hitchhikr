# Concept

## Basics

Problems to solve:

1. As a hitchhiker in a foreign city, i dont know good places to start my journey.
2. Friends and family are worried about those hitchhiking friends.

Solutions:

1. Good access to Hitchwiki Maps database for mobile devices
2. Possibility to log Hitchhikers activities easily (where they are, which car etc.). Make activities accessable to friends and family.

### Account isn't a must

Some of the features should be accessable without a login/account. E.g. searching for nearby hitchhiker spots.

## Tools

### API's

We will fetch data from [Hitchwiki Maps](http://hitchwiki.org/maps/).

And here is a [API blueprint](http://hitchhikr.apiary-mock.com/) for internal data-transfer.

### Frontend

The UI will be bild with one of these Frameworks:

- AngularJS
- Backbone.js

We should evaluate if [hood.ie](www.hood.ie) is fitting in our plans.

### Backend

tba.

### Helper

This could help during the developement:

- [apiary](http://apiary.io/)
