# Concept

## Basics

Problems to solve:

1. As a hitchhiker in a foreign city, i dont know good places to start my journey.
2. Friends and family are worried about those hitchhiking friends.

Solutions: 

1. Good access to Hitchwiki Maps database for mobile devices
2. Possibility to log Hitchhikers activities easily (where they are, which car etc.). Make activities accessable to friends and family.

## Tools

Internal data will mostly be delivered as json. The exchange to and from Hitchhikr-Server will be done via [CRUD-API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete).

### Frontend

The UI will be bild with one of these Frameworks:

- AngularJS
- Backbone.js

### Backend

tba.
